        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <p>As founders, we're always looking for new ways to innovate.
        New ideas to champion. New approaches to old problems.
        softwarejameson.dance is <em>born</em> in the open. Our story is
        as radical as our tech is disruptive.<p>

        <p>It all started one day on Twitter, when <a href="https://twitter.com/edelman215">edelman215</a> remarked
        that <a
                 href="https://twitter.com/softwarejameson">softwarejameson</a> kind of looked like this one dude in a
        TikTok meme. Well? The rest is history. We assembled an
        engineering team, scrapped together our first prototype and went
        in for a big round of funding.</p>

        <p>That's where you come in. Have you considered donating to
        <a
            href="https://supporters.eff.org/donate">the
            EFF</a>? Think about it. Privacy is at stake! Look! People can just make embarrassing websites about other people!</p>
